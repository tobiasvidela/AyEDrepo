## Run Basic Calculator 2
In order to compile and run the C programs in this repository, you will need to have CodeBlocks installed on your computer.

[How to install and setup CodeBlocks (with all you need)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJqsmitR2I)

Once you have CodeBlocks installed, follow these steps:

1. Open CodeBlocks and create a new c/c++ file. You can do this by clicking on "File" in the menu bar, then selecting "New" and "File...".

1. Copy the C code from the BasicCalculator file and paste it into the new file you just created in CodeBlocks.

1. Once you have pasted the code, save the file. You can do this by clicking on "File" in the menu bar, then selecting "Save file".

1. Click on the "Build and Run" button in the compiler toolbar. This will compile and run the program you just created. If there are no errors in your code, you should see the output of the program in the console window.

1. Try the Basic Calculator 2.

### Note
If you are _not_ running this on __Windows__, you __must change__ the `system(cls)` for `system(clear)`.
This was only tested on CodeBlocks IDE and Windows 10.
